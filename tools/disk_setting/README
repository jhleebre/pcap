mk_part.sh

 Make a partition at each disk.
 You may need to run this only with the new disks which have no partition yet.
 You can check whether a disk has its partition or not at /dev/ directory.
 For example, if you can find both /dev/sda and /dev/sda1, the disk /dev/sda has its own partition /dev/sda1, and you don't need to make a partition for the disk.

mk_fs.sh

 Make a file system at each disk.
 You may need to run this whenever you want to format the existing disks.
 Please check the disk name carefully not to format the main file system.
 Use df to check the name of the main file system.

mk_dir.sh

 Make work_* and meta_* under /mnt/ for later file system mounting.

mk_files.sh

 Make 1 GB files to each disk to pre-allocate disk blocks.

mount.sh

 Mount file systems to /mnt/work_* and /mnt/meta_*.

unmnt.sh

 Unmount file systems mounted to /mnt/work_* and /mnt/meta_*.

clear.sh

 Simply remove every file in /mnt/work_* and /mnt/meta_* by using rm command.

Example

1. Install new hard disks (no partitions) and mount them.

 mk_part.sh > mk_fs > mk_dir.sh > mount.sh > df

2. Format used hard disks to clean up every data.
 
 unmnt.sh > mk_fs.sh > mount.sh > df
